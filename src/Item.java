//  ok, how do I set multiple item types? I need 4 or 5 offensive weapons, and their counterparts
//    Offensive: hockey stick, strategically-placed banana, bored magician, vengeful ex, frozen chicken dropped from 10000 meters
//    Defensive: kite shield, M4 Sherman tank, overprotective mother, Rolls-Royce Phantom, apocalyptic bunker
